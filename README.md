# KingOfTheHill
Node and Express JS server for a King of the Hill game type.  This is designed for the DFW Nerf group.

# Other Games Types
As of now, this is currently set to track data for a King of the Hill game type but other game types are desired.  Examples of these are:

Seals: 
- Name of every Seal player
- Lives of each Seal
- Remaining time

Bomb Run:
- Time remaining to place bomb before round is over.
- Alert when bomb is placed
- Time remaining before bomb is set off

# How to start
1. Ensure Node is installed on your machine.
2. Navigate to the project folder in your Terminal/Command Prompt.
3. Run "npm install" and wait several secconds.  This will look at the package.json file and install all dependencies.
4. Run "node Server.js" (If doing development, instead run "nodemon Server.js" to automatically restart the server upon file changes.)

This will start the server on Port 3000 as of now.
